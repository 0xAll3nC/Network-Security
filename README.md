# Network-Security

Network security is a crucial aspect of information technology that involves protecting computer networks and data from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. It encompasses a range of practices, technologies, and processes designed to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network infrastructure and data. This includes the implementation of firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and encryption protocols to defend against cyber threats such as malware, phishing attacks, and network breaches. Network security also involves regular monitoring and analysis of network traffic to detect and respond to potential vulnerabilities and attacks. By ensuring a secure network environment, organizations can protect sensitive information, maintain customer trust, and support the continuous operation of critical IT systems.
